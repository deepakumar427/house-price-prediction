# 🏠 House Price Prediction with Geospatial Data

This project uses machine learning (Random Forest Regressor) to predict housing prices in California based on geospatial and demographic data.

## 🔍 Features
- Predict house price using location, income, rooms, and proximity to ocean
- Random Forest Model with RMSE evaluation
- Geospatial visualization using Folium
- Interactive prediction with user input

## 📁 Dataset
California Housing Dataset (from Hands-On Machine Learning by Aurélien Géron)
